- 👋 Hi, I’m Joao!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and basic Python. Looking forward to learn some backend. 
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate, as I'm pretty much dumb on coding.
- 📫 You can reach me through @joaonasimulacao on twitter or instagram.
